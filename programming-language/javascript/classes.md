# Classes

### Class Instantiation

Instantiation class means creating an object from a class. We need the keyword _new_ and we call the name of the class after the word new.

Let us create a dog object from our Person class.

```javascript
class Person {
  // code goes here
}
const person = new Person()
console.log(person)

// PersonÂ {}
```
