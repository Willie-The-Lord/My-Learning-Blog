# Classes

### Class Instantiation

Instantiation class means creating an object from a class. We need the keyword _new_ and we call the name of the class after the word new.

Let us create a dog object from our Person class.

```javascript
class Person {
  // code goes here
}
const person = new Person()
console.log(person)

// Person {}
```

### Inheritance

Using inheritance we can access all the properties and the methods of the parent class. This reduces repetition of code. If you remember, we have a Person parent class and we will create children from it. Our children class could be student, teach etc.

```javascript
// syntax
class ChildClassName extends {
 // code goes here
}
```

Let us create a Student child class from Person parent class.

```javascript
class Student extends Person {
  saySomething() {
    console.log('I am a child of the person class')
  }
}

const s1 = new Student('Asabeneh', 'Yetayeh', 'Finland', 250, 'Helsinki')
console.log(s1)
console.log(s1.saySomething())
console.log(s1.getFullName())
console.log(s1.getPersonInfo())
```

```javascript
Student {firstName: "Asabeneh", lastName: "Yetayeh", age: "Finland", country: 250, city: "Helsinki", …}
I am a child of the person class
Asabeneh Yetayeh
Student {firstName: "Asabeneh", lastName: "Yetayeh", age: "Finland", country: 250, city: "Helsinki", …}
Asabeneh Yetayeh is Finland. He lives Helsinki, 250.
```
